# Gift Genius

## Description

We wanted to create an application that people could use to create interactive wish list for gifts. We wanted it to be something that was simple and easy to navigate, so it was accessible to loved ones even with lower engagement and interest in complicated technologies, and create an application where friends and family could interact with each wish list and mark what had already been purchased.

This application provides a central place where family and friends can post gift requests for a variety of people and occasions. While working on this project, we learned about tying together REACT components to structure pages and designing the back-end structure of a MERN stack application. This application leverages MongoDB and is deployed on Heroku. We learned more about interacting with and structuring code for the back-end data stored in Mongo.
